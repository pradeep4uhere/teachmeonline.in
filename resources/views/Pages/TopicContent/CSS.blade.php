    CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and visual styling of a document written in HTML or XML. It provides a set of rules and properties that define how elements on a web page should be displayed, including their layout, colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual aspects.

CSS allows you to separate the style and layout of a web page from its structure, making it easier to apply consistent styling across multiple pages and maintain a clean and organized codebase. Here are some key concepts and features of CSS:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
<h3>Selectors:</h3> CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements that you want to style. You can select elements by their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or hierarchical relationships with other elements.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
<h3>Properties and Values:</h3> CSS properties define the specific aspect of an element that you want to style, such as color, font-size, margin, padding, and many more. Properties are paired with values that determine the desired appearance or behavior for that property.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
<h3>Stylesheets:</h3> CSS rules are typically defined within stylesheets. Stylesheets can be included in an HTML document using the <code><'style'></code> tag within the <code><'head'></code> section, or they can be linked externally using the <code><'link'></code> tag to separate the CSS code from the HTML.
</p>
<p class="mb-6">
<h3>Cascading and Specificity:</h3> CSS follows a cascading model, where multiple styles can be applied to an element, and the final appearance is determined by the order of styles and their specificity. Specificity refers to the weight or importance of a selector in relation to others.
</p>
<p class="mb-6">
<h3>Inheritance:</h3> CSS properties can be inherited by child elements from their parent elements. This allows for efficient and consistent styling, as properties applied to higher-level elements can be automatically inherited by their nested elements.
</p>
<p class="mb-6">
    <h3>Media Queries:</h3> CSS includes media queries, which allow you to apply different styles based on specific conditions, such as the screen size or device orientation. Media queries enable responsive design, ensuring that the layout and styling of a website adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
</p>

CSS is a powerful tool for web design and allows you to customize the look and feel of your web pages. It offers flexibility, modularity, and the ability to create visually appealing and engaging user experiences. By combining HTML and CSS, you can create beautifully styled and structured web pages.
